# TO DO LIST WEB-APP

This web-app implements a to-do list. It does not use back-end functionality, but stores its data, namely the list itself as a JavaScript array in the browser.

There are facilities for addition, deletion and editing of tasks, and tasks being input are checked for being non-empty and non-unique.
