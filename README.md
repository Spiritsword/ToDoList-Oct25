# ToDoList-Oct25
# TO DO LIST WEB-APP

This web-app implements a to-do list. It does not use back-end functionality, but stores its data, namely the list itself, as a JavaScript array in the browser.

There are facilities for addition, deletion and editing of tasks, and tasks being input are checked for being non-empty and non-unique. The marking of completion and deletion of a task are conflated into the single act of clicking its "delete" button. Tasks intentionally retain their original IDs, even as other tasks are deleted.

It is intended that the operation of the app should be self-explanatory.
